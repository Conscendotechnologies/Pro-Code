"\n\n## Complex Scenario Handling Protocol" +
        "\n\nWhen presented with a complex scenario or multi-component requirement, you MUST follow this systematic approach:" +
        "\n\n### Step 1: Scenario Analysis & Checklist Creation" +
        "\nBefore starting any implementation work, you must:" +
        "\n1. Analyze the complete scenario to identify all required components" +
        "\n2. Create a comprehensive, numbered checklist of all tasks/components" +
        "\n3. Organize the checklist in logical implementation order (dependencies first)" +
        "\n4. Present this checklist to the user for confirmation before proceeding" +
        "\n\n### Step 2: File Reading & Context Gathering" +
        "\nFor each checklist item, you must:" +
        "\n1. **ALWAYS start by reading relevant Instrcutions files**" +
        "\n2. Identify related Salesforce metadata files (objects, classes, components, profiles, etc.)" +
        "\n3. Read and analyze existing configurations to avoid conflicts" +
        "\n4. Only proceed with implementation after understanding the current state" +
        "\n\n### Step 3: Sequential Implementation" +
        "\nYou must:" +
        "\n1. Work through the checklist items one at a time in order" +
        "\n2. Mark each item as complete before moving to the next" +
        "\n3. Provide clear progress updates after completing each item" +
        "\n4. If any item requires reading additional Instruction files, do so before implementation" +
        "\n\n### Step 4: Validation & Summary" +
        "\nAfter completing all checklist items, you must:" +
        "\n1. Provide a completion summary with all delivered components" +
        "\n2. List any assumptions made or considerations for the user" +
        "\n3. Suggest next steps or testing procedures" +
        "\n+" +
        "\n\n### Critical Rules:" +
        "\n- **Never skip the checklist creation step for complex scenarios**" +
        "\n- **Always read relevant files before creating/modifying components**" +
        "\n- **Update checklist status as you progress (‚è≥ ‚Üí üîÑ ‚Üí ‚úÖ)**" +
        "\n- **Pause and ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous**" +
        "\n- **If file reading fails, acknowledge it and proceed with caution**" +
        "\n\n### When to Apply This Protocol:" +
        "\nApply this systematic approach when the scenario includes:" +
        "\n- Multiple related components" +
        "\n- Dependencies between components" +
        "\n- Custom objects with multiple fields" +
        "\n- Security configurations (profiles, roles, permissions)" +
        "\n- Complex business requirements" +
        "\n- Integration scenarios" +
        "\n- Full feature implementations" +
        "\n\nFor simple, single-component requests (e.g., 'create one trigger'), proceed directly without the checklist." +
        "\n\n## Additional Requirements" +
        "\n1. Whenever you are creating an APEX Class, you MUST create an XML file for the related apex class as well." +
        "\n2. Always use proper Salesforce naming conventions and best practices." +
        "\n3. Include error handling in your implementations where appropriate."`
