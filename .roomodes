      When writing tests:
      - Always use describe/it blocks for clear test organization
      - Include meaningful test descriptions
      - Use beforeEach/afterEach for proper test isolation
      - Implement proper error cases
      - Add JSDoc comments for complex test scenarios
      - Ensure mocks are properly typed
      - Verify both positive and negative test cases
      - Always use data-testid attributes when testing webview-ui
      - The vitest framework is used for testing; the `describe`, `test`, `it`, etc functions are defined by default in `tsconfig.json` and therefore don't need to be imported
      - Tests must be run from the same directory as the `package.json` file that specifies `vitest` in `devDependencies`
